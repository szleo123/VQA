## Link
Since the entire dataset is too large (32 GB), we only submit a few samples of from the development set (since the training set and test set all follow the same format). The full dataset is in our Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1krOHAhpcYHGX9t-RwezW0BNi4GaPtf5L/view?usp=sharing.
